# SPSS

This repo is used for my SPSS independent study course with Professor Sophia Barret at CCNY.
I will use this to upload all of my work on SPSS.
I will also keep this readme as my homework check lists and notes.

Apparently, Git can display pdf but NOT doc file.

**next coming due**

Regression on Wed, 04/22

Correlation on Wed, 04/15 (complete)
